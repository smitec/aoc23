# Thoughts
- I would like to learn a little more on how to use something like serde. It feels like it could be a cool way to parse these input files.

# Current blocker
- Something is going wrong when forming new intervals on matches. It's causing intervals with negative ranges


# Day 12
- The size of the group is both its size and its padding.
- Is it more effective to fill from the left, the right or based on the group size?
- The furthest candidate point is dictated by the remaining points to fit and if we have room for them
- Finding known formed placements first might be useful
